# aws-policy-generator uses a simple format for policy generation.
#
# Under the 'policies' key there can be either 'service' or 'action' items.
#
# See below for examples.

policies:
    # Adds permissions for all of the IAM service. Only list
    # permissions are granted, so read/write/tagging/permissions related
    # actions are excluded.
    - service: iam
      access_level: list

    # Adds permissions for the instance resource type in EC2.
    # Write, Read and List permissions are granted, but tagging/permissions
    # actions are excluded.
    - service: ec2
      access_level: write
      resource_type: instance

    # Adds Read and List access to all of AWS Lambda.
    - service: lambda
      access_level: read

    # Adds full access to S3 (i.e. s3:*)
    - service: s3
      access_level: all

    # You can also add multiple services at once
    - access_level: read
      service:
        - lambda
        - s3
        - iam
      
    # Adds the s3:ListBuckets action permission, scoped to only
    # the given resource.
    - action: s3:ListBuckets
      resource: arn:aws:s3:::my-test-bucket
      
    # Same as above, but with multiple resources
    - action: s3:ListBuckets
      resource:
        - arn:aws:s3:::my-test-bucket
        - arn:aws:s3:::my-test-bucket/*
